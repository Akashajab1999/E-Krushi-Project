 <summary>109. What are the different areas of Security Management in cloud?  </summary>
  <p>Different areas of Security management in cloud are as folows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>I. Identity Management : </b>This aspect creates dif erent level of users, roles and their credentials to access the services in cloud. </li>
        <li><b>II. Access Control : </b>In this area, we create multiple levels of permissions and access areas that can be given to a user or role for 
accessing a service in cloud environment. </li>
        <li><b>III. Authentication :</b> In this area, we check the credentials of a user and confirm that it is the correct user. Generaly this is done by 
user password and multi-factor authentication like-verification by a one-time use code on cel phone. </li>
        <li><b>IV. Authorization :</b> In this aspect, we check for the permissions that are given to a user or role. If a user is authorized to access a 
service, they are alowed to use it in the cloud environment.</li>
    </ol>

 <summary>110. What are the main cost factors of cloud based data center? </summary>
  <p>Costs in a Cloud based data center are different from a traditional data center. Main cost factors of cloud based data center are as follows: </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>I. Labor cost :</b> We need skilled staff that can work with the cloud-based datacenter that we have selected for our operation. Since 
cloud is not a very old technology, it may get difficult to get the right skil people for handling cloud based datacenter. </li>
        <li><b>II. Power cost :</b> In some cloud operations, power costs are borne by the client. Since it is a variable cost, it can increase with the 
increase in scale and usage. </li>
        <li><b>III. Computing cost : </b>The biggest cost in Cloud environment is the cost that we pay to Cloud provider for giving us computing 
resources. This cost is much higher compared to the labor or power costs. </li>
    </ol>

 <summary>111. How can we measure the cloud-based services? </summary>
  <p>
In a cloud-computing environment we pay for the services that we use. So main criteria to measure a cloud based service its usage.  </p>
   <p>For computing resource we measure by usage in terms of time and the power of computing resource.  </p>
<p>For a storage resource we measure by usage in terms of bytes (giga bytes) and bandwidth used in data transfer. </p>

<p> Another important aspect of measuring a cloud service is its availability. A cloud provider has to specify the service level agreement (SLA) for the 
time for which service wil be available in cloud. </p>

 <summary> 112. How a traditional datacenter is different from a cloud environment?</summary>
  <p>In a traditional datacenter the cost of increasing the scale of computing environment is much higher than a Cloud computing environment. Also in a 
traditional data center, there are not much benefits of scaling down the operation when demand decreases. Since most of the expenditure is in 
capital spent of buying servers etc., scaling down just saves power cost, which is very less compared to other fixed costs.   </p>
   <p> 
Also in a Cloud environment there is no need to higher a large number of operations staf to maintain the datacenter. Cloud provider takes care of 
maintaining and upgrading the resources in Cloud environment. </p>
<p>With a traditional datacenter, people cost is very high since we have to hire a large number of technical operation people for in-house datacenter. </p>

 <summary> 113. How will you optimize availability of your application in a Cloud environment? </summary>
  <p> 
In a Cloud environment, it is important to optimize the availability of an application by implementing disaster recovery strategy. For disaster 
recovery we create a backup application in another location of cloud environment. In case of complete failure at a data center we use the disaster 
recovery site to run the application.   </p>
   <p> 
Another aspect of cloud environment is that servers often fail or go down. In such a scenario it is important to implement the application in such a 
way that we just kil the slow server and restart another server to handle the traffic seamlessly. </p>

<details>
 <summary>117. Why companies now prefer Cloud Computing architecture over Client Server Architecture? </summary>
  <p>  
In Client Server architecture there is one to one communication between client and server. Server is often at in-house datacenter and client can 
access same server from anywhere. If client is at a remote location, the communication can have high latency.  </p>
  <p>In Cloud Computing there can be multiple servers in the cloud. There wil be a Cloud controler that directs the requests to right server node. In 
such a scenario clients can access cloud-based service from any location and they can be directed to the one nearest to them. </p>
  <p>Another reason for Cloud computing architecture is high availability. Since there are multiple servers behind the cloud, even if one server is down, 
another server can serve the clients seamlessly.</p>

<details>
 <summary>118. What are the main characteristics of Cloud Computing architecture?  </summary>
  <p>Main characteristics of Cloud Computing architecture are as folows:  </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>I. Elasticity : </b>In Cloud Computing system is highly elastic in the sense that it can easily adapt itself to increase or decrease in load. 
There is no need to take urgent actions when there is surge in traf ic requests.</li>
        <li><b>II. Self-service provisioning :</b> In Cloud environment users can provision new resources on their own by just caling some APIs. 
There is no need to fill forms and order actual hardware from vendors.</li>
        <li><b>III. Automated de-provisioning :</b> In case demand/load decreases, extra resources can be automatically shut down in Cloud 
computing environment.</li>
        <li><b>IV. Standard Interface :</b> There are standard interfaces to start, stop, suspend or remove an instance in Cloud environment. Most of 
the services are accessible via public and standard APIs in Cloud computing. </li>
        <li><b>V. Usage based Billing : </b>In a Cloud environment, users are charged for their usage of resources. They can forecast their bil and 
costs based on the growth they are expecting in their load. </li>

 <summary>121. What are the main components of a VPN? </summary>
  <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) consists of following main components:  </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>I. Network Access Server (NAS): </b>A NAS server is responsible for setting up tunnels in a VPN that is accesses remotely. It 
maintains these tunnels that connect clients to VPN. </li>
        <li><b>II. Firewall :</b> It is the software that creates barrier between VPN and public network. It protects the VPN from malicious activity that 
can be done from the outside network.</li>
        <li><b>III. AAA Server : </b>This is an authentication and authorization server that controls the access and usage of VPN. For each request to 
use VPN, AAA server checks the user for correct permissions</li>
        <li><b>IV. Encryption : </b>In a VPN, encryption algorithms protect the important private data from malicious users. </li>
    </ol>

 <summary>125. What are the important points to consider before selecting cloud computing? </summary>
  <p> Cloud computing is a very good option for an organization to scale and outsource its software/hardware needs. But before selecting a cloud 
provider it is important to consider following points:   </p>
  <ol>
        <li><b>I. Security : </b>One of the most important points is security of the data. We should ask the cloud provider about the options to keep 
data secure in cloud during transit and at rest. </li>
        <li><b>II. Data Integrity : </b>Another important point is to maintain the integrity of data in cloud. It is essential to keep data accurate and 
complete in cloud environment.  </li>
        <li><b>III. Data Loss :</b> In a cloud environment, there are chances of data loss. So we should know the provisions to minimize the data loss. It 
can be done by keeping backup of data in cloud. Also there should be reliable data recovery options in case of data loss.  </li>
<li><b>IV. Compliance :</b> While using a cloud environment one must be aware of the rules and regulations that have to be followed to use the 
cloud. There compliance issues with storing data of a user in an external provider’s location/servers.</li>
<li><b>V. Business Continuity :</b> In case of any disaster, it is important to create business continuity plans so that we can provide 
uninterrupted service to our end users.</li>
<li><b>VI. Availability :</b> Another important point is the availability of data and services in a cloud-computing environment. It is very important 
to provide high availability for a good customer experience.</li>
<li><b>VII. Storage Cost :</b> Since data is stored in cloud, it may be very cheap to store the data. But the real cost can come in transfer of data 
when we have to pay by bandwidth usage. So storage cost of data in cloud should also include the access cost of data transfer.</li>
<li><b>VIII. Computing Cost :</b> One of the highest costs of cloud is computing cost. It can be very high cost with the increase of scale. So 
cloud computing options should be wisely considered in conjunction with computing cost charged for them.</li>
    </ol>
